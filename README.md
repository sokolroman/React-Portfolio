## Deployment

This API is deployed on [Heroku]([https://git.heroku.com/react-portfolio-btcmp.git](https://react-portfolio-btcmp.herokuapp.com)).

## Header

The header of the portfolio includes my name and a navigation bar with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio: About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume. The title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.

## Navigation

By clicking on a navigation title, you can view the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading. When the portfolio is first loaded, the About Me title and section are selected by default.

## About Me

The About Me section includes a recent photo or avatar of me and a short bio about my professional experience and skills.

## Portfolio

The Portfolio section includes titled images of six of my applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository. This allows you to see my work in action and view the code behind it.

## Contact

The Contact section includes a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message. If you move your cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, you will receive a notification that this field is required. If you enter text into the email address field, you will receive a notification if you have entered an invalid email address.

## Resume

The Resume section includes a link to a downloadable version of my resume, as well as a list of my proficiencies.

## Footer

The footer includes text or icon links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, as well as my profile on a third platform (such as Stack Overflow or Twitter). This allows you to view my online presence and connect with me on these platforms.

I hope you enjoy viewing my portfolio and learning more about my skills as a web developer. Thank you for visiting!
